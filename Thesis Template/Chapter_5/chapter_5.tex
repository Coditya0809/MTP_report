\section{Future Work to be Done}

So far, the track and hold switch and slicer of the unit ADC have been designed and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso tool USMC $65\,nm$ technology package. By the end of this semester, the complete design and simulation of the ADC is expected to be completed. \\
In the second part of my thesis, further enhancements will be made to the designed sub-ADC and will be made useful for integrating the ADC-based Receiver with SerDes links in real life.

\label{Conclusions}

The results thus far obtained of the circuits designed were found to be satisfactory as approved by me supervisor Dr Nijwm Wary. Few circuits in this report have been directly attached as screen shots taken from Cadence Virtuoso. I hereby, claim no responsibility of those diagrams. In future reports, I will take care that all the circuits will be drawn by me and the plots will be redrawn.
