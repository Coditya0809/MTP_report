# MTP_report
Tex files for making MTP report. \br

The main fle to be edited is IITBBS_PhD_Thesis_Main_File.tex. \br

Other content can be edited in files coverpage.tex, frontmatter.tex, glossary_2.tex, Abstract/abstract.tex, Appendices/appendix<number>.tex, Chapter<number>/chpter<number>.tex, bibliography.bib in that order. \br
  
  Work in the ```Thesis Template``` directory and add images from that directory. (Thesis Template must be your current working directory in order to compile the main tex file successfully). \br
  
  Either upload the Thesis Template directory to Overleaf or  clone this repo and work on your own PC with Tex editing tools like TexMaker. \br
  
  Direct links for downloads: \br

  Note that you will need a tex compiler to handle all the tex packages to be used. For that I have used MikTex. It's download link is: https://miktex.org/download \br
  
  While installing MikTex, make sure to select ```Yes``` from the dropdown menu when asked for ```Install missing packages in the fly: ```. \br
  
  The rest of the installation can be defaulted. \br
